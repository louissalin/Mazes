synopsis: FFI domain specific language, on top of hsc2hs.
description: This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI.
             They were designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces,
             so that hsc2hs can extract from them all Haskell code needed to
             mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are automatically
             derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances
             of Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code
             to help write bindings to inline functions or macro functions.
             Documentation is available at package homepage:

             The extra module Bindings.Utilities will contain tools that may
             be convenient when working with FFI.
